# VENative Blazor Service Generator

VENative Blazor Service Generator is a project designed to simplify applications created with Blazor Web App. By leveraging source code generators, this project automatically creates a SignalR hub for your services and generates a consumer for this hub on the WebAssembly client. This eliminates the need for manual client-side implementation, accelerating the development process for your Blazor applications while enhancing interactivity.

All you need to do is decorate your interface and implementation with an attribute, and that's it! Your service can be consumed from WebAssembly effortlessly!

## Project Status
This project is in its early stages of development. As such, it is **not recommended** for use in production environments due to the high likelihood of breaking changes.

## Features
- **Automatic SignalR Hub Generation**: Automatically generates a SignalR hub for your services.
- **WebAssembly Client Integration**: Creates a consumer for the SignalR hub, eliminating manual client-side implementation.
- **Improved Development Speed**: Simplifies and accelerates the development of interactive Blazor applications.

## Considerations
1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Authentication and authorization need to be addressed, as SignalR hubs support method-level authorization.
2. **Security**: Potential vulnerabilities must be analyzed and mitigated.
3. **Testing**: More test cases need to be developed to ensure reliability and robustness.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- Run the example Blazor project included in the repository.

## Limitations
- No NuGet package is currently available.
